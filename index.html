                  <blockquote>Born in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, Captain Vikram Batra of 13 J&K Rifles, is known as the hero of the Kargil war. He led one of the toughest war operations in Kashmir, and was also called Sher Shah (in the intercepted messages of the Pakistani army).
                    He was instrumental in recapturing Peak 5140, which is located at an altitude of 17,000 feet. During this mission, Batra was seriously injured but still managed to kill three enemy soldiers in close combat. After capturing Peak 5140, he went on yet another difficult mission to recapture Peak 4875 on July 7, 1999. Batra made a call to his father before he left and told him about the crucial mission. Hardly did he know that this would be his last call home.
                    A famous quote by Batra is: “Either I will come back after hoisting the tricolour (Indian flag), or I will come back wrapped in it, but I will be back for sure.” He was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.

                  <blockquote>Major General Ian Cardozo, who has many achievements to his name, will always be known for his immense courage in the 1971 war with Pakistan. He was, at the time, a young major with 5 Gorkha Rifles. During the war, he stepped on a landmine and severely injured his leg. When even the doctor could not cut his leg, Cardozo asked for a khukri (the Gorkha knife) and cut his own leg off, saying, “Now go and bury it!”
                    The incident did not deter Cardozo from going on to serve his country. Through sheer willpower and determination, he continued to perform his duties as a soldier and became the first disabled officer in the Indian Army to command an infantry battalion and a brigade. In spite of not being physically at par with other officers, he defeated many ‘two-legged’ soldiers to come first in many fitness tests during his stint in the army.

                  <blockquote>This brave soldier of Fourth Kumaon regiment sacrificed his life at the young age of 24.
                    On November 3, when Sharma’s company was on a patrol of Badgam village, it was approached by a tribal lashkar of 700 raiders from the direction of Gulmarg. The company was soon surrounded from three sides and endured heavy casualties from the ensuing heavy mortar bombardment.
                    His last message to Brigade HQ, received a few moments before he was killed, was: “The enemy is only 50 yards from us. We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to our last man and our last round.”
                    Major Somnath Sharma was the first recipient of the Param Vir Chakra. The citation on the award says, “His leadership, gallantry and tenacious defence were such that his men were inspired to fight the enemy by seven to one, six hours after this gallant officer had been killed.”

                  <blockquote>Naik Jadu Nath Singh, the fourth recipient of the Param Vir Chakra, fought in Jammu and Kashmir in the Indo-Pak war of 1947/48.On the crucial day of February 6, 1948, Singh was in command of a forward post at Taindhar. Nine men garrisoned the post.
                    The Pakistanis launched their attack in successive waves to take this post. With four wounded men, he re-organised his force to face another onslaught.
                    When all his men, himself included, were wounded, he took over the Bren gun from the wounded gunner and continued to fight. The enemy were now on the walls of the post but Singh’s fire was so devastating that the post was saved for a second time.
                    Every one in his post was dead by now. Wounded and alone, Sharma charged out of his post with his sten gun firing, surprising the enemy and forcing it to flee back in confusion again. But two bullets caught Sharma in the head and chest and this gallant soldier died instantly.

                    It was late night when Parameswaran was returning from search operations in Sri Lanka, when his column was suddenly attacked by a group of militants. He did not panic and showed great presence of mind by encircling the enemy from the rear and surprising them with an unexpected attack. During the hand-to-hand combat, a militant shot him in the chest. Undaunted, Major Parameswaran snatched the rifle from the militant and shot him dead.
                    Barely able to stand now, he continued giving orders to his men and inspired them to fight till his last breath. The Indians managed to kill five militants and recovered three rifles and two rocket launchers from the militants.

                  <blockquote>Born in Bibipur, Uttar Pradesh, this man of steel joined the Indian army in 1934. During the Indo-Pakistan war of 1947/48, Brigadier Usman repulsed a fierce attack on Naushera and Jhangar, two highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir, and was named by his fellow soldiers ‘The Lion of Naushera.’
                    At the time of the Partition, he was made the offer of becoming the Chief of the Pakistani Army but he chose to stay in India. He left the Baloch regiment of Pakistan and was inducted into the Dogra regiment in India. After the Battle of Naushera, where the Pakistanis suffered heavy casualties at his hands, the same country that had courted him to become the chief of the army, now went ahead and placed prize money of Rs. 50,000 on his head.
                     His last words were, “I am dying but let not the territory we were fighting for fall to the enemy.”
                    He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously for his great courage and leadership
